synopsis~: let's get the build set up properly

details: 

Let's make sure the CI build is passing. When build fails please fix or ask for help.

Please take a look at the build.sh in your assign1 repository. Then the one in your assign2 repository. Walk through them, think about what each one of them does and if everything it needs is in place.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
